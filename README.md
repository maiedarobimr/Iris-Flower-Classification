# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using petal and sepal measurements.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
- Understand classification problems
- Explore datasets with pandas and seaborn
- Use KNN or Decision Tree classifier from scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the notebook.
2. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells in order.

## 📈 Model Performance
Includes evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
